# To-do List Project

#### This to-do list project is derived from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE8aYoGK0Ec">this tutorial video</a>, but it's a TypeScript-React.JS version of that one.
#### Update: Added React Hot Toast and Tailwind Scroll Bar to the project. <br>
#### The To-do List is stored in your localStorage, so it will remain when you close the browser; but it will vanish if you clear the browser's cache. 

### Have a nice day! From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ku4nm1N.b1gDr4goN/">Big DragoN üêâ</a> with love!
